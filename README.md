## Instructions

Create an Ether unit conversions panel.

The names of the 7 Ether denominations are listed [here.](https://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ether.html)

The "show panel" / "hide panel" buttons should show/hide a panel that displays a given value in all 7 denominations; a user should be able to modify any of the 7 values and have the others update accordingly (with their equivalent value). 

The initial value (in gwei) upon opening the panel being should be the value in the input field at the time the panel is opened. 


**Target time**: 60-90 minutes

45-60 minutes: Core functionality 

15-30 minutes: make it look nice
